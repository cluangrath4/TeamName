This project is to assist individuals with vision impairments. It identifies objects in the environment using YOLOv8 and provides verbal feedback via text-to-speech (TTS), enabling users to navigate their surroundings more independently.

Features
● Real-Time Object Detection: Identifies objects from a live webcam feed.
● Audio Feedback: Announces detected objects and their colors aloud.
● Color Detection: Provides contextual details, e.g., "red chair."

The project empowers visually impaired users by transforming visual data into auditory feedback, enhancing mobility, safety, and independence in daily life.
