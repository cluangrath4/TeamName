To start the UI, start a virtual env and install flask and run main.py


conda create -n ui_env python=3.9
conda activate ui_env
conda install anaconda::flask


The speech to text is implemented, but idk about how to show red rectangle on the video
The button makes a http request and then we run test.py so change that to actual backend after it is implemented
